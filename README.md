# Machine-learning-Final-project

In this project we use the "Students Performance in Exams" Dataset -https://www.kaggle.com/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams,
the Dataset created To understand the influence of the parents background, test preparation etc on students performance.
This data set includes scores from three exams and a variety of personal, social, and economic factors that have interaction effects upon them.

We used four methods on the Dataset to answer the following questions:
1) "Given the average grades and ethnicity - what is the gender of the student?".
2)"Based on all the information, what is the student's ethnicity?".
3)"Based on grades and sector What is the early education the student received?".


Here are the methods and success rates of each method:

Ouestion #1:

| Method        | Success rate |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Adaboost      | 0.854  |
| SVM           |  0.874  |
| K-NN          | 0.826  |
| Logistic Regression  | 0.844  |


Ouestion #2:

| Method        | Success rate |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Adaboost      | 0.697  |
| SVM           | 0.525  |
| K-NN          | 0.690  |
| Logistic Regression  | 0.611  |


Ouestion #3:

| Method        | Success rate |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Adaboost      | 0.559  |
| SVM           | 0.521  |
| K-NN          | 0.526  |
| Logistic Regression  | 0.535  |
